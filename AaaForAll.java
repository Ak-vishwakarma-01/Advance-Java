/*
    JavaFX was intended to replace Swing as the standard GUI library for Java SE.
    The majority of new Java GUI applications are based on JavaFX.
    JavaFX has a number of advantages over Swing. It is more lightweight, and has more sophisticated design controls. It uses CSS styling for components, and XML can 
    be used to develop the GUI layout (with FXML and Scene Builder).
    Swing can only be used to create rich client desktop applications. JavaFX can be used to create the same rich desktop applications, as well as rich web applications 
    that can run across a wide variety of devices.
    JavaFX is both an alternative to web-based development and an alternative to other toolkits for building GUI desktop/mobile applications.
